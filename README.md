Plan A: dataset about Projects posted on kickstarter with various information such as main_category, (sub)category, pledged amount and

        - What main-category of project has the highest success rate?
        - For the main-category of project with highest success rate (question above), what is the category with highest number of project              
          proposal?
        - What month recorded the most backers (not unique backers, cannot find if a backer invested in several projects)?
        - What is the number of successfully funded projects with more than 5.000$ pledged per category?
        - For the main-category with most successfully funded projects, provide mapping of projects per goal.


Plan B: TSA Claims - lost property, damaged property, missed flights etc. and their respective dispositions (were they      
        successful or not)

    - Which type of item has had the most claims, and were they successful or not?
    - How many claims are made against each airline, and were they denied or approved?
