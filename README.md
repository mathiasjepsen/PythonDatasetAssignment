# Plan A: 
A dataset about projects posted on kickstarter with various information such as main_category, (sub)category, pledged amount and status

Kaggle page: https://www.kaggle.com/kemical/kickstarter-projects/data

    - What main-category of project has the highest success rate?
    - For the main-category of project with highest success rate (question above), 
        what is the category with the highest number of project proposals?
    - What is the median pledged amount (usd_pledged_real) of successfully funded projects?
    - What is the number of successfully funded projects with more than 5.000$ pledged 
        (usd_pledged_real) per category?
      (OPTIONAL: In case you decide to visualize all successful projects per category and you perceive any clusters in the   
        results, try to use the MeanShift algorithm on to see if your gut feeling was correct)
    - For the main-category with the most successfully funded projects (quantity, not rate of success), what is the goal-           
        amount range (usd_goal_real), e.g. range 0-10k$ , 5-15k$, 100k$-110k$, that contains the most successfully funded   
        projects (in quantity, not rate of success)?


# Plan B: 
TSA Claims - lost property, damaged property, missed flights etc. and their respective dispositions (were they      successful or not)
        
URL: https://github.com/mathiasjepsen/PythonDatasetAssignment/raw/master/claims-2010-2013_0.xls
  
    - Which claim type is the most frequent?
    - Which type of item has had the most claims, and were they successful or not?
    - How many claims are made against each airline, and were they denied or approved?
    - Which hours of the day do claims get made the most?
    - In which month do the most claims get made?
