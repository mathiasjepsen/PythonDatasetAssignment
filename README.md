# Plan A: 
A dataset about projects posted on kickstarter with various information such as main_category, (sub)category, pledged amount and status

Kaggle page: https://www.kaggle.com/kemical/kickstarter-projects/data

    - What main-category of project has the highest success rate?
    - For the main-category of project with highest success rate (question above), 
        what is the category with the highest number of project proposals?
        (OPTIONAL: In case you perceive any clusters in the results, try to use the MeanShift algorithm on them)
    - What is the median pledged amount (usd_pledged_real) of successfully funded projects?
    - What is the number of successfully funded projects with more than 5.000$ pledged 
        (usd_pledged_real) per category?
    - For the main-category with the most successfully funded projects (quantity, not rate of success), 
        what is the range of goal-amount (usd_goal_real) a 10k usd range, e.g. range 0-10k$ , 5-15k$, 
        100k$-110k$, that contains the most successfully funded projects (in quantity, not rate of success)?


# Plan B: 
TSA Claims - lost property, damaged property, missed flights etc. and their respective dispositions (were they      successful or not)
        
URL: https://github.com/mathiasjepsen/PythonDatasetAssignment/raw/master/claims-2010-2013_0.xls
  
    - Which claim type is the most frequent?
    - Which type of item has had the most claims, and were they successful or not?
    - How many claims are made against each airline, and were they denied or approved?
    - Which hours of the day do claims get made the most?
    - In which month do the most claims get made?
